## Image classification for icons

Raised 2026-09-23 during sheet import milestone 3.

Could an image model classify icons automatically, for example suggesting a subtype
("saguaro", "barrel"), the kind (point or pattern), or which way an icon faces?

- The tool was named as "jev". Confirm which tool is meant. Likely candidates are CLIP
  (matches an image against text labels such as "a cactus") or Meta's V-JEPA (image and
  video embeddings, no text labels on its own).
- Where it would run: in the browser (small model download, keeps processing off the
  server as the spec requires) or on Cloudflare Workers AI (server side, which changes
  the spec's "all processing in the browser" rule).
- What it would fill in: subtype suggestions, pattern versus point, facing direction
  (the current rule-based guess is weak), or flagging near-duplicate icons across sheets.
- Cost and licence of the model.

## Facing detection is a rough guess

Milestone 3 sets `facing` automatically only for clearly lopsided icons, using which side
carries more ink. On the sample sheets this is right for most animals but can mislabel
shaded objects (the pyramid reads as facing right because of its hatching). Every
automatic value is marked "(auto)" in the review grid and can be overridden.

## Adding a box by hand

The review tools cannot draw a brand-new box around an icon the splitter missed
completely. Not in the spec; add it if it turns out to be needed.
